NAME
    Acme::Roman - Do maths like Romans did

SYNOPSIS
        use Acme::Roman;

        print I + II; # III, of course!

DESCRIPTION
    The Roman Empire ruled over a large part of the ocidental world for a
    long time, probably too long for the conquested people.

    They were finally won and there are some who say it was because they
    could not do mathematics. Such liars!

    This module redeems Perl with the ungratefully forgotten Roman numbers,
    which now can find their glory again.

INSPIRATION
    That module was inspired by

        Ruby Quiz - Roman Numerals (#22)
        http://rubyquiz.com/quiz22.html

    See the hightlighted solution at the Quiz Summary in the same page.

EXAMPLES
    Take a look at eg/roman.pl in this distribution for an amusing example.

BUGS
    Acme::Roman does not like numbers greater than 3999. Why would you like
    such big numbers?

    Only knows how to do addition, subtraction and multiplication. What else
    do you think that Romans did with such a lovely numeric system?

    Ranges (like I..X) don't work :(

    The actual implementation does a bit of brute force when defining empty
    prototypes so that barewords are resolved into subroutine calls. I don't
    know if it can be fixed.

    If you find a bug, tell Julio Caesar from a respectful and safe
    distance. (He's always looking for entertainment at the circus. And
    lions are ever hungry.) If you prefer, you might file a report at
    http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=Acme-Roman or via e-mail at
    bug-Acme-Roman@rt.cpan.org. (Hey, CPAN RT does not like me and I never
    get the bug reports. So, for now, you might like to include me in the
    receivers list.)
